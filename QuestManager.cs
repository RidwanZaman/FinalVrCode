        "**Shellfish Creatures and Acidification**\nOysters, Mussels and shellfish creatures alike construct their shells from calcium carbonate. Increased ocean acidification reduces carbonate ion availability, hindering shell formation and compromising their structural integrity.\r\n",
        "**Turtles and Sand Temperatures**\nSea turtle hatchling sex ratios are temperature-dependent; balanced sand temperatures are crucial to ensure a healthy mix of male and female turtles, supporting stable population dynamics\r\n",
        "**Octopuses and Coral dependence**\\n​Octopuses are highly intelligent creatures that rely on coral reefs for shelter and survival. However, rising ocean temperatures and acidification are destroying these reefs, leaving octopuses exposed and vulnerable to predators. Additionally, heat stress from ocean warming can impair octopus vision by reducing essential proteins in their eyes, further threatening their survival. These combined factors contribute to declining octopus populations.\r\n"
